    <h2>What You Get</h2>
    <p>A senior .NET developer who slots into your team's workflow — your stand-ups, your sprints, your tools. I pick up tickets, review code, unblock juniors, and ship features. But I also bring strategic thinking: identifying architectural improvements, reducing technical debt, and mentoring your team.</p>

    <h2>How I Work</h2>
    <p>I use your tools (Azure DevOps, Jira, GitHub — whatever you've got). I attend your ceremonies (stand-ups, retros, planning). I follow your coding standards. The goal is to feel like a permanent team member who happens to be on a contract.</p>

    <h2>What Sets Me Apart</h2>
    <p>I've led development teams across three UK councils for 9+ years. I understand stakeholder management, deadline pressure, and the realities of working in large organisations. I'm not just a coder — I'm a tech lead who can make your whole team more effective.</p>

    <h2>Ideal For</h2>
    <p>Teams with a temporary capacity gap. Organisations that need senior expertise for a critical project. Teams that want to upskill junior developers through mentoring and pair programming. Managers who need a trusted tech lead while they hire permanently.</p>

    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>£500/day for full-time embedded work (minimum 1 month). Discounted rates for 3+ month engagements. Part-time arrangements available — 2-3 days per week at £550/day.</p>
