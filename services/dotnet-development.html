    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>Your organisation needs a custom application but your internal team is stretched, or you don't have in-house .NET expertise. You've been quoted by agencies who want to lock you into long contracts and hand the work to junior developers. You need someone senior who can own the project end-to-end, deliver production-quality code, and hand it over cleanly when they're done.</p>
    <p>Or perhaps you have an existing .NET application that's become painful to maintain. Features take weeks instead of days. Bugs keep reappearing. Nobody wants to touch certain parts of the codebase. You need someone who can untangle the complexity and get your project moving again.</p>

    <h2>What You Get</h2>
    <p>Production-ready .NET applications built with clean architecture principles. Every project includes unit tests, integration tests, API documentation, and CI/CD pipelines. I write code that's easy to read, test, and extend — because someone else will maintain it after I'm done.</p>
    <p>Beyond the code itself, you get clear communication throughout the project. Weekly progress updates, demo sessions at the end of each sprint, and documentation that means your team can maintain and extend the application independently after handover.</p>

    <h2>Common Projects</h2>
    <p>The types of .NET applications I build most frequently include internal business applications that replace spreadsheet-based workflows, customer-facing web portals with authentication and role-based access, RESTful API backends serving web and mobile frontends, data processing services that handle imports, transformations, and reporting, and workflow automation tools that eliminate repetitive manual processes.</p>
    <p>I've also built reporting dashboards pulling data from multiple sources, document management systems with versioning and audit trails, form builders for organisations that need to collect structured data, and integration middleware connecting legacy systems to modern platforms.</p>

    <h2>How I Work</h2>
    <p>Every project starts with a discovery session — typically 60 to 90 minutes — where I understand your requirements, constraints, and priorities. I'll ask about your users, your existing systems, your team's technical capabilities, and your timeline. From that session, I produce a brief proposal with scope, estimated cost, and a suggested approach.</p>
    <p>Once we agree on scope, I work in two-week sprints. Each sprint has a defined goal and produces working, deployable software. You can review progress at any point, and we adjust priorities as the project evolves. This means you're never more than two weeks from seeing tangible results.</p>
    <p>At the end of the project, I run a structured handover session with your team. I walk through the architecture, explain key decisions, and make sure everyone is comfortable with the codebase. I also provide 30 days of post-delivery support at no additional cost for bug fixes related to the delivered scope.</p>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>I follow clean architecture or vertical slice patterns depending on project size and complexity. For smaller applications, a well-structured monolith with clear separation of concerns is often the right choice — simpler to deploy, easier to debug, and cheaper to host. For larger systems or those that need to scale independently, I'll design service boundaries that make sense for your domain.</p>
    <p>My standard tooling includes Entity Framework Core for data access, MediatR for CQRS where the complexity warrants it, FluentValidation for input validation, and Serilog for structured logging. All of this is configurable — if you have existing patterns or preferences, I'll adapt to them rather than imposing my own.</p>

    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>C#, ASP.NET Core 8, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, SignalR, Blazor, Razor Pages, MVC, Minimal APIs, xUnit, Moq, Docker, and Azure App Service. I'm also experienced with Azure Functions for serverless workloads, Azure Service Bus for messaging, and Application Insights for monitoring and diagnostics.</p>

    <h2>Example Scenario</h2>
    <p>A county council needed to replace a paper-based process for tracking planning applications. The existing system was a combination of spreadsheets, shared folders, and email chains. I built a web application using ASP.NET Core and Blazor that gave planning officers a dashboard view of all active applications, automated status notifications to applicants, and produced the statutory reports required by central government. The project took 8 weeks from discovery to production, and the team has been maintaining it independently ever since.</p>

    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>Project-based work from £60/hour. Small applications such as forms, dashboards, and simple CRUD tools typically cost between £3,000 and £8,000. Medium complexity applications with authentication, integrations, and reporting usually fall in the £8,000 to £20,000 range. Larger systems are quoted individually after a detailed requirements gathering session.</p>
    <p>I always provide a fixed-price estimate before work begins, so you know exactly what you're committing to. If the scope changes during the project, I'll flag it immediately and agree the impact before proceeding.</p>
