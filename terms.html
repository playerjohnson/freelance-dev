    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>These terms govern the provision of freelance software development and consulting services by Anthony D Johnson ("the Developer"), based in Peterborough, United Kingdom. By engaging services, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>Services include but are not limited to: .NET and C# development, Azure cloud migration, DevOps pipeline setup, legacy system modernisation, API integration, team augmentation, and technical consulting. The specific scope, deliverables, and timeline for each engagement will be agreed in writing before work begins.</p>

    <h2>Quotations &amp; Pricing</h2>
    <p>All quotations are valid for 30 days unless otherwise stated. Prices are quoted in GBP and are exclusive of VAT (the Developer is not currently VAT registered). Project-based work is quoted at a fixed price. Consulting and augmentation work is billed at the agreed hourly or daily rate. Any work outside the agreed scope will be quoted separately before proceeding.</p>

    <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
    <p>For project-based work, a 30% deposit is required before work begins, with the balance due upon completion. For ongoing engagements, invoices are issued monthly and are payable within 14 days. Late payments may incur interest at 8% above the Bank of England base rate, in accordance with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Upon full payment, all intellectual property rights in the deliverables are assigned to the client, unless otherwise agreed in writing. The Developer retains the right to use general knowledge, skills, and experience gained during the engagement. The Developer may reference the project in their portfolio unless the client requests confidentiality in writing.</p>

    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>The Developer will treat all client information as confidential and will not disclose it to third parties without written consent, except where required by law. This obligation survives the termination of any engagement.</p>

    <h2>Warranties &amp; Liability</h2>
    <p>The Developer warrants that all work will be performed with reasonable skill and care. A 30-day defect correction period is included from the date of delivery, during which bugs directly attributable to the delivered work will be fixed at no additional cost.</p>
    <p>The Developer's total liability for any claim arising from an engagement shall not exceed the total fees paid for that engagement. The Developer shall not be liable for indirect, consequential, or incidental damages, including lost profits or data.</p>

    <h2>Cancellation &amp; Termination</h2>
    <p>Either party may terminate an engagement with 14 days' written notice. Upon termination, the client shall pay for all work completed to date. Any deposit paid is non-refundable once work has commenced.</p>

    <h2>Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>Neither party shall be liable for delays caused by circumstances beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters, pandemics, government actions, or infrastructure failures.</p>

    <h2>Website Use</h2>
    <p>This website is provided for informational purposes. While every effort is made to ensure accuracy, the Developer makes no warranties about the completeness or accuracy of the content. Blog articles and resources do not constitute professional advice.</p>

    <h2>Blog Content &amp; Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>Blog posts, guides, and other educational content on this site are provided for general information only. They do not constitute professional, legal, tax, or financial advice. In particular:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content discussing <strong>IR35</strong>, employment status, or tax implications is general information only and should not be relied upon for individual IR35 status determinations. Always seek advice from a qualified tax professional or employment law specialist.</li>
        <li>Technical recommendations may not be suitable for your specific environment, security requirements, or compliance obligations. Always test in a non-production environment first.</li>
        <li>References to government frameworks, procurement processes, or public sector requirements reflect the Developer's understanding at the time of writing and may have changed since publication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Privacy</h2>
    <p>Personal data is handled in accordance with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and UK data protection legislation.</p>

    <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>If a dispute arises from an engagement, both parties agree to attempt to resolve it informally through good-faith negotiation before pursuing formal proceedings. If the dispute cannot be resolved within 30 days, either party may refer the matter to mediation through the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR) before initiating court proceedings.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
