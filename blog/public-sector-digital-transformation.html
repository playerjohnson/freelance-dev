<p>I've spent over 9 years building digital services for UK local government — across three councils at 3C Shared Services. Here's what I've learned about what actually works in public sector digital transformation.</p>

    <h2>Start With the Problem, Not the Technology</h2>
    <p>The best government digital projects start by understanding what residents and staff actually need, not by choosing a technology platform. I've seen councils spend millions on enterprise platforms that nobody uses because the procurement was technology-led rather than problem-led. Talk to your users first.</p>

    <h2>GDS Standards Matter</h2>
    <p>The Government Digital Service design principles exist for a reason. "Start with user needs", "do the hard work to make it simple", and "iterate, then iterate again" aren't just slogans — they're the difference between services people use and services people avoid. Apply them even if you're not building a central government service.</p>

    <h2>Legacy Systems Are the Real Challenge</h2>
    <p>Every council has systems from the early 2000s (or earlier) that are critical to daily operations but painful to maintain. Planning systems, revenues and benefits, housing — these are often the systems most in need of modernisation and the hardest to change. The answer isn't to replace them overnight but to gradually wrap them in modern APIs and build new interfaces on top.</p>

    <h2>Shared Services Work (With the Right Approach)</h2>
    <p>Sharing development teams across multiple councils makes financial sense. But it only works if you standardise where possible and customise where necessary. Trying to build completely bespoke systems for each council defeats the purpose. Equally, forcing identical solutions on councils with genuinely different needs creates frustration.</p>

    <h2>Security and Compliance Aren't Optional</h2>
    <p>Government systems handle sensitive personal data. GDPR compliance, Cyber Essentials Plus certification, and PSN compliance are baseline requirements. Build security into your development process from the start — security reviews, dependency scanning, penetration testing. Bolt-on security after the fact is expensive and incomplete.</p>

    <h2>What's Next</h2>
    <p>Cloud-first policies are driving Azure and AWS adoption. Low-code platforms are handling simpler workflows. AI is starting to appear in customer service (chatbots, automated triage). But the fundamentals haven't changed: understand your users, build iteratively, test with real people, and ship working software regularly.</p>
