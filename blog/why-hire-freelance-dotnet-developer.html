<div class="article-content fade-up">
<p>When you need .NET development work done, you typically have three options: hire full-time, use an agency, or hire a freelancer. Here's why freelance developers are increasingly the smart choice for project-based work.</p>

    <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>
    <p>A senior .NET developer in the UK commands £65,000–£85,000 in salary alone. Add employer NI, pension, benefits, equipment, office space, and recruitment fees, and you're looking at £90,000–£120,000 per year. An agency charges £600–£1,000 per day. A freelancer? £400–£600 per day — with no overhead, no notice period, and no commitment beyond the project.</p>
    <p>For a 3-month project, the maths is clear. Full-time hire: ~£30,000 (plus 3 months to recruit). Agency: £36,000–£60,000. Freelancer: £24,000–£36,000 — and they start next week.</p>

    <h2>Speed to Start</h2>
    <p>Recruiting a full-time senior developer takes 2-4 months in the current market. An agency needs 2-4 weeks to source someone. A good freelancer can start within days. When you have a deadline, speed matters.</p>

    <h2>Expertise on Demand</h2>
    <p>Full-time hires need to be generalists — they'll work on whatever comes up. Freelancers specialise. Need someone who's done Azure migrations for government? You can find exactly that. Need Entity Framework performance optimisation? There's a freelancer who does it daily. You get depth of expertise that's hard to find in a generalist hire.</p>

    <h2>Lower Risk</h2>
    <p>If a full-time hire doesn't work out, you're looking at performance improvement plans, notice periods, and potentially months before you can try again. With a freelancer, the contract has clear deliverables and timelines. If it's not working, you wrap up and move on. No HR process required.</p>

    <h2>How to Find the Right One</h2>
    <p>Look for specific experience relevant to your project, not just years of experience. Ask for examples of similar work. Check their GitHub or portfolio. Do a paid trial (a small initial task) before committing to a full project. And talk to their previous clients — references matter more than CVs.</p>

    <h2>When Not to Freelance</h2>
    <p>If you need someone permanently, hire permanently. If you need a team of 5+, an agency might coordinate better. And if your project requires deep institutional knowledge that takes months to acquire, a short-term freelancer might not be the best fit. But for defined projects with clear scope? Freelance is hard to beat.</p>
